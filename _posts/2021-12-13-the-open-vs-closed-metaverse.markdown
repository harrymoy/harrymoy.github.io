You would have heard the term 'metaverse' a lot more recently. All thanks to Facebook changing their name to Meta. But the metaverse has been around for a lot longer than you may have thought. Fortnite and Roblox are games of recent popularity that bring to mind the metaverse. Cast your mind back, however, and there are many more examples. World of Warcraft (WoW) is the first majorly popular example I can think of. And it still has millions of players to this day.[^1] These are all centralized examples of the metaverse. Where one entity builds and governs. Yet, in the crypto/Web3 space, shadowy super coders are building a decentralized metaverse. And this is where we, as consumers, have to decide what kind of metaverse we want to live in. Or if we're going to live in one altogether.

So what exactly is the metaverse? It's complicated. Rather than offer a dictionary definition, I'll give my understanding. The metaverse is a persistent virtual world where people can meet. Games are the first to come to mind, but even something like Microsoft Teams could become a metaverse. Okay, now that's cleared up - what exactly is the decision we have to make?

The decision is we choose which metaverse to be a part of. Because although we say 'metaverse' as a singular, it is in reality plural. We will select what metaverse we want to join. In crypto, shared ownership is common amongst projects. I was recently given 210 tokens[^2] for owning harrymoy.eth. The tokens represented a vote in future governance for the project. Crypto protocols let you vote on changes to the protocol if you hold their token. If you bought a Meta share, would you get a voice in their product development? Could you influence their internal decisions? No. Not unless you held billions of dollars worth of shares. But let’s say the crypto protocol went against its community - the community could choose to use the old version, whether the protocol leaders liked it or not.

And that is why I'd choose a decentralized, or open, metaverse. Because what concerns me most about closed metaverses is the values of their owners. The spirit of crypto is "wagmi" or "we're all gonna make it", that as a collective, we're all going to succeed. Meanwhile, in their "responsible innovation principles" list, Meta had "put people first" as their fourth item. Fourth. You'd think, given recent controversy, they'd have the self-awareness to put that top of the list, even just for optics. But they don't give a shit. Their values align to their own interests, rather than the community they serve. And the community they’re serving has no economic stake. The tokens I mentioned earlier have a value and are liquid. If the project they govern rises in popularity, my tokens rise in value. Like shares, but the votes I have with tokens have much greater influence than shares. This spirit increases the likelihood that I’ll contribute to the project.[^3] And if they make it, I’ll make it.

I will jump to conclusions by assuming Meta's, or any large tech company's, metaverse will be closed. You'll not be able to transfer your items between metaverses easily. Your metaverse identity will be tied to whichever you use. In an open metaverse, you will be able to. Loot is an NFT project that is a JPEG of items, but the idea is you own these items. Any metaverse that uses Loot will recognize your items. They’re yours. Unlike a virtual sword in WoW, you can bring these items across the open metaverses. Why do people buy cosmetic items in games that serve no functional purpose? Because it's an expression of identity. Similar to the clothes we choose to wear. So, for us to bring our cosmetic items across metaverses, our identity also crosses metaverses. Meta, Microsoft, Google, etc. do not own my identity. I do. 

Throughout the ‘10s, Facebook (as it was called at the time) succumbed to the will of Apple and Google, whose mobile operating systems account for 99% of the market. Apple, who makes privacy a product feature, repeatedly made changes that caused problems for Facebook[^4]. So it shouldn’t be a surprise for me to assume Meta are trying to own the metaverse because they want to be gatekeepers. Zuckerberg is like Nolan Serrento from Ready Player One.[^5] In the book IOI (who Serrento works for) build on top of GSS's OASIS platform - when ownershio of the OASIS becomes available (which is the plot of the book), IOI mobilize all of their resources to take control. The metaverse in real-life needs its own equivalent of the gunters.

Desktop and mobile operating systems became closed gardens with deep pocketed gatekeepers. I don’t want to see the metaverse take the same route.
