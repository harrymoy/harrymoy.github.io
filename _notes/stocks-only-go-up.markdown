Before the pandemic started, there had never been more wealth in human history. The performance of the Dow Jones, S&P etc. demonstrates that. There may be small infractions but generally, they move upwards.

There are suggestions that economically, the post-pandemic recovery will take years. Years of more stimulus and more quantitative easing. But looking at the stock market, you’d think the recovery had already taken place. We’re seeing markets hit all-time highs. There’s still a need for a recovery? 

With cash getting cheaper and cheaper, it only makes sense to move cash into other assets. That could be stocks, gold, crypto or others. After a long period of time, investments will grow. Returns will be massive. Time in the market is better than timing the market.
