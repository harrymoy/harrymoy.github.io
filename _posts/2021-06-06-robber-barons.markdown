summary: A century ago, a group of men became some of the richest in history. In the 21st century, history is repeating itself with a new group of men amassing signficant wealth. And hate along the way.

In the late nineteenth century, a group of people accumulated significant wealth. To this day, they are what we think of as stereotypical ‘industry titans’. They were the Robber Barons. Members of this group include John D Rockefeller (oil),  Andrew Carnegie (steel), Cornelius Vanderbilt (railroad), and more. 

They earned the Robber Baron nickname for their ruthless and anti-competitive behaviour. And the vast wealth they amassed. The working class despised them, thinking Robber Barons didn't fairly earn their money. 

And then, for nearly the next century, this class of men went into hiding. The Great Depression and post-war reconstruction slowed down wealth creation, but in the Information Age, the class is re-emerging. And with it, a new debate around wealth inequality, industrialism and exploitation. But this recent debate is an example of history repeating itself. The question is will the new Robber Barons face the same fate?

## Who Were the Robber Barons?

Rockefeller Center, Carnegie Hall and Stanford University. They’re a few well-known places named after the Old Robber Barons. The History Channel describes them as ‘The Men Who Built America’, representing the other side in the dichotomy of how they’re perceived.

John D. Rockefeller was one of the wealthiest men in history. His wealth, in 2020 money, would be $423b—nearly 2% of America’s GDP.

There are stereotypes of old-school oil barons in today’s culture—ruthless and cunning businessmen who would do anything to pursue money. Rockefeller is the inspiration. His company Standard Oil operated a monopoly over the United States oil market. If you were a business needing oil, it had to go through Standard Oil. Standard managed 100,000 employees and 20,000 oil wells. At one point, it controlled 90% of the world’s oil refining. 

Andrew Carnegie immigrated from Scotland as a child and built a steel business that made him the second wealthiest American in history. Carnegie, throughout his life, dedicated himself to philanthropy and donated nearly all of his wealth. 

It’d be difficult to transport oil and steel around the US if there were no railroads. Fortunately for the other Barons, Cornelius Vanderbilt laid the railroad around much of the North East United States. And in a similar vein to Rockefeller, you had to go through Vanderbilt if you wanted to transport goods over a railroad. 

Vanderbilt was a shipping emperor, starting at the age of 16 with steamboats. He eventually started constructing the railroad and amassed a net worth of $223b in today’s money. 

They were some of the Old Barons; now we see the New Barons. A new class of industrialist competing in a digital age. They include Jeff Bezos (founder and CEO of Amazon), Mark Zuckerberg (founder and CEO of Facebook) and Elon Musk (CEO of Tesla and founder and CEO of SpaceX). 

What do the Robber Barons of Old and New share? Where they earned their wealth, creating wealth for others, and egotism.

## America - Land of opportunity?

When America separated from Great Britain, it eschewed the monarchy. ‘All men are created equal’, the Declaration of Independence read. And so, the Founders built a nation that had no aristocracy. There were no dukes, no earls, no viscounts, and no barons; no titles by birthright. To become a baron, you had to earn it. 

In place of the aristocracy was the ‘American Dream’, the idea implanted in Americans that they can achieve anything. That America is a land of opportunity, available to anybody who grabs it. Growing up as a Brit, my country did not encourage such optimism. Britannia did not tell me to dream. That seems uniquely American. And it makes me wonder if that is why what the Barons achieved they could only succeed in America. 

What also helped was that America was still in its infancy. 

After the Civil War, America was rebuilding. And it rose like a phoenix from the ashes. But the opportunity in those ashes had to be found, and that’s what the Barons of old did. A large nation needed a way to get around, so Cornelius Vanderbilt laid the railroad. Towering structures needed steel to keep them sturdy, so Andrew Carnegie mined steel. And oil kept the lights on, so John D Rockefeller refined oil. 

And in the late 20th century and now 21st century, the capital America acquired supports the New Barons. And its approach to risk. In America, taking risks is promoted. Meanwhile, Europe is unable to change its conservative ways. Amazon didn’t make a profit for the first sixteen years it was on the stock market. Sixteen. Now, it’s worth over 1.5 trillion. That growth wouldn’t happen in Europe, the share price would collapse, and shareholders would move to kick Bezos out. But America has a longer investment time horizon. 

Elon Musk, a South African immigrant, acknowledges that only in America could he build the companies he’s making:

> “America is still the land of opportunity more than any other place, for sure.”

> “It always seemed like when there was cool technology or things happening, it was kind of in the United States. So, my goal as a kid was to get to get to America basically.”

The Baron-America relationship isn’t one-way, however. 

Without the Industrial Revolution, Britain would not have built its empire, the largest in history. And similarly, America owes its advancements to the businesses of the Barons. The Founding Fathers and Presidents come to mind when thinking of men who influenced America, but what about the business titans? Without Standard Oil, Microsoft, New York Central Railroad, Amazon and more, would America be where it is today? 

Probably not.

Yet, America came for the Old Barons - and it’s coming for the New Barons.

### Baron Busting

In 1890, the US Government carved Standard Oil into 34 pieces. 34 pieces. Those pieces became, or were acquired by, ExxonMobil, Chevron and BP. Later, Theodore 'Teddy' Roosevelt, 26th President and immortalized on Mount Rushmore, imposed a policy of ‘trust-busting. In Teddy’s mind, companies were getting too large and exploiting the market. So he broke them up.

US politicians today want to channel Teddy Roosevelt. Elizabeth Warren (a Democrat) called Teddy (a Republican) her favourite president. Warren and many others believe the Big Tech companies are too large, so Facebook is in their sights. Facebook not only runs Facebook, but it also owns Instagram and WhatsApp. I cannot overstate the influence Facebook has over the zeitgeist. And that’s why Warren et al. wants to break it up. 

I doubt the politicians of today will succeed as their predecessors did. The landscape is different, and businesses come and go. Before Facebook, there was MySpace[^1], and before MySpace, there was Friendster. Trust-busting in the 19th/20th centuries occurred because there was no competition. I don’t have Facebook or Instagram, but I do have Twitter. An alternative.

## Wealth Creators

Adam Smith theorized the ‘Invisible Hand’, self-interest makes the world better. Jeff Bezos’ quest for wealth creates jobs, paying people money that they can use for food. So there’s less hunger. But some feel it isn’t enough, that he should do more. If Jeff Bezos is worth $200b, someone should take it away and redistribute it. How can anyone, let alone one man, need $200b? This argument isn't new. 

Bezos isn't taking shit from his critics. In his 2021 shareholder letter, he emphasized the wealth Amazon generated for others: 

” They estimate that, in 2020, third-party seller profits from selling on Amazon were between $25 billion and $39 billion, and to be conservative here I’ll go with $25 billion.”

“In 2020, employees earned $80 billion, plus another $11 billion to include benefits and various payroll taxes, for a total of $91 billion.”

Bezos’ emphasis is a response to criticisms of Amazon’s size and how wealthy it’s made him. Many blame retail store closures on Amazon’s increasing popularity. But can you blame the customers? They’re getting almost any product they want, at low prices, and without needing to leave their house. 

A strong logistics network drives Amazon’s efficiency. But so does cheap and exploited labour. Is it possible to admire Amazon’s wealth generation for others while also believing it should treat its employees fairer? Yes, it is, and I do. 

I’m a capitalist[^2], and I have no shame in admitting that. Capitalism is a net good to society. Humanity has capitalism to thank for the lowest hunger rates in history (whenever you read this, this statement will still apply). Evolution has taken form through capitalism. Vaccinations are an example of that; they are a medical wonder developed thanks to scientific progress. What drove the progress? Profit.

Without Rockefeller’s oil, would humanity have gotten so far so quickly I could publish this over the internet? Without Vanderbilt’s railroad? I doubt it. The Robber Barons of old and new are innovators, even if it may not seem it. As society advances, tackling climate change is one of our greatest challenges, and electrifying cars are a way to combat it. Do we not owe the rise of electric cars to Elon Musk’s Tesla creating the first competitive electric car? There’s no question. And without the electric car, can we overcome climate change?
 
And without the riches gathered on the way, would these men have continued on their pursuits? 

No.

## Egotism

Throughout their lives, Robber Barons gave wealth away. John D. Rockefeller developed philanthropy into how we see it today. Targeted, focused and purpose-driven charitable enterprises focusing capital on large-scale research. His money helped deliver a Yellow Fever vaccine and provide safety to scholars fleeing Nazis.

Today, we see the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Bill Gates, Microsoft founder) and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative acting similarly. But is this image-washing? Many consider the mentioned philanthropists to be evil monopolists or the cause of division and hatred in society. They say these charitable foundations are just an expensive exercise in PR to repair their image. And that argument makes sense; it’s probably true. Yet, does it matter? If Rockefeller nearly eradicated Yellow Fever and Bill Gates succeeds in his efforts against Malaria because of PR, do you care? I don’t. Not ending Malaria, so people think Bill Gates is a bastard is a bad idea.

Gates and Zuckerberg aren’t only taking a leaf out of Rockefeller’s book, however. By investing nearly all of their wealth through their charitable foundations, they’re Andrew Carnegie’s gospel. Carnegie was seen as radical when he wrote ‘Wealth’ in 1889. Here’s an excerpt:

> “There remains, then, only one mode of using great fortunes; but in this we have the true antidote for the temporary unequal distribution of wealth, the reconciliation of the rich and the poor--a reign of harmony--another ideal, differing, indeed, from that of the Communist in requiring only the further evolution of existing conditions, not the total overthrow of our civilization. It is founded upon the present most intense individualism, and the race is projected to put it in practice by degree whenever it pleases. **Under its sway we shall have an ideal state, in which the surplus wealth of the few will become, in the best sense the property of the many, because administered for the common good, and this wealth, passing through the hands of the few, can be made a much more potent force for the elevation of our race than if it had been distributed in small sums to the people themselves.**”

Carnegie is not arguing for removing wealth from the rich like some socialists, and communists, suggest. He believes it is the rich’s responsibility to distribute their money for the greater good. Carnegie was good by his word and donated nearly all of his wealth away. Despite that, we’ve still heard of him. Is it because of steel? Probably not; it’s because of Carnegie Hall or Carnegie Mellon University. So like Rockefeller, Gates and Zuckerberg, he made people aware of his donations by placing his name at the forefront of his work. 

If philanthropy is a PR exercise, is it also an ego boost? Yes. Philanthropy is a rich man’s version of a teen uploading a photo of them giving money to a homeless person. The Barons are only operating at a different level.  But again, does it matter? Still, the answer is no. So what if it makes them feel good about themselves? We as a species are better off because of it. 

And there’s going beyond philanthropy, way beyond. 

Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are engaging in a battle. A battle that we mere mortals can only aspire to be a part of. Space. Both men are on a mission to make life multi-planetary. Musk, at the time of writing, is further ahead. But Bezos has resigned as CEO of Amazon to focus more time on his space company, Blue Origin. 

Their battle is a new Space Race. There are no national superpowers in this race. Only two billionaires, each determined to beat the other. Twenty years ago, who would have thought we’d rely on two billionaires to take our species to another planet? Very few. Yet now that’s where we are. And if either achieves their goal, imagine the power they may wield. Do they get to define the rules of the new planets? Even as a supporter of their efforts, my answer to that question is, “I hope not”.

On the whole, I believe Robber Barons were/are a net good to our society.  They create(d) jobs, donate(d) to improve humanity and develop(ed) infrastructure that we all depend upon. And they also teach us a lesson. A lesson about hard work because they earned their title. Whether you agree or disagree with how they got there, they earned it. And that’s an important lesson. Some were born with wealthy parents who supported them; others weren’t. But they all worked hard to get to their position. 

What’s remarkable about the 21st century is you don’t need to start a steamboat or oil business to become a Baron. Zuckerberg began from his dorm room and Bezos from his garage. Zuckerberg, Bezos, Musk,[^3] Brin and Page[^4], Ellison[^5], Gates and more all switched on their computers. 

The amount of money available now may as well be infinite. There’s an unfathomable sum out there in the world. For me, it’s better to get a seat at the table than it is to sit back and moan. All of these men worked hard to get to where they are. Maybe there was some luck on the way, but hard work and steely determination are how they earned their riches. 

If we work hard, maybe we can become barons.

Endnote: Writing this piece was a journey for me. It’s allowed me to reflect further on my political beliefs. And on top of that, it’s the culmination of my time on the On Deck Writer’s fellowship. I know I still have a long way to go on my writing journey, but I owe a lot to On Deck. 

In eight short weeks, I’ve developed international friendships and spoken with people with all kinds of different stories. Some of the conversations I’ve had have been life-changing. I’ve experienced the future of education thanks to On Deck, and as an alumnus, I’m excited to see how it continues to grow. 

[^1]: Tom Anderson sold MySpace and earned $100m from it. An unfathomable sum. Zuckerberg is worth 1,000 times that amount. 

[^2]: Nowadays, 'capitalist' is used as a dirty label. I don’t understand why. Capitalists create jobs and push humanity forward. 

[^3]: Musk’s first business venture was Zip2, a business he started with his brother. From there, he’d go on to create what became PayPal, and with the riches from that business, he’d invest in Tesla early on and found SpaceX.
