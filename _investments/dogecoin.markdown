summary: Thoughts and rationale on why I own Dogecoin
---

I'd be lying if I said that there's any analytical thinking behind my investment in Dogecoin. Simply, if it hits $1, I'll have nearly $12,000 from a small investment. And I can afford to lose it all. So from a risk/reward perspective, I'm prepared to take the loss.

*I'm not even putting this into the typical format. The above paragraph is both an argument for and against.*
