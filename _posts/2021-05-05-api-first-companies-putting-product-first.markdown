> "A generation ago, if you wanted to build a business empire, you needed to open a factory. Today, you only need to open a laptop." - Alex Ohanian

That line is from the web series Small Empires. And it's stuck with me since I first heard it. But as I watched it, I couldn't believe it was that simple. 

A few years ago, a good friend and I had an idea for a travel start-up. I spent a long time focusing on how to architect the project. After spending so long overthinking how to build it, we gave up. It all felt overwhelming. Accepting card payments, managing accounts and integrating customer service channels. Itâ€™s no small feat. Juggling both full-time work and starting a company from scratch felt like an impossible task. 

I didn't realize then all the options we had. Not only with cloud computing, but integrating payments, managing customers and more. 

Software lego companies, sorry, API-first companies, are abstracting away the complexity of technology. They're building on the groundwork cloud computing giants have laid. API-first companies write software, so others don't have to:

- Want to accept payments? Use Stripe
- Implement video? Twilio
- Build a bank? Plaid

And it's as simple for developers as calling the API. No longer do wannabe founders have to slave away writing thousands of lines of code to innovate. Although they still can't build Rome in a day, [maybe a week.](https://twitter.com/caldbeckj/status/1277417203902472192)

Packy McCormick, in his essay [APIs All the Way Down](https://www.notboring.co/p/apis-all-the-way-down), wrote:

>"This is the beauty of API-first companies. They allow customers to focus on the one or two things that differentiate their businesses, while plugging in best-in-class solutions everywhere else."

With powerful technology at their fingertips, founders can focus on product. Consider the great technology leaders of today - Zuckerberg, Bezos and Musk. They were all great engineers in their day and probably still are. But they became exceptional product leaders and visionaries. That's why you know their names.

For the business idea mentioned earlier, if we had plugged into APIs instead, [I could be diving into a vault of money like Scrooge McDuck right now](https://harrymoy.com/future-you-porn). Twilio or Stripe could have been the golden ticket. Because away from building the 'complicated' stuff, we could focus instead on developing our product. 

Clubhouse's audio tech isn't unique; Twitter has already rolled out its competitor. For Clubhouse, it's their discovery that sets them apart. Rooms are found quickly, and jumping into them isn't hard. In this case, their audio tech doesn't matter. It's their product that shines. How many Twitter Spaces have you come across? It's Clubhouse's design and product vision that makes the difference. Not Agora's audio API. That is where the war is won, and it doesn't apply only to the social audio market.

And then there are the boring fundamentals. The basic functionality that you come to expect from websites and applications. Think of making a card payment on an e-commerce site. It's rare to notice a payment system when it performs well, but we notice when it's poor.

That's where Stripe comes in. 
 
Stripe offers a payment API, among other e-commerce APIs. And they're worth $95b thanks to it. Why would a company build a payment system when it can integrate with Stripe? Instead, they can quickly build what they have to (payments) thanks to the API and focus on what matters (their product).

In every market, *product matters.*
