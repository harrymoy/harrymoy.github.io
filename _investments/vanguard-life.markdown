summary: Thoughts and rationale on why I buy the Vanguard ETF
---

This is a boring ETF that I hold, set to medium risk. Each month, a direct debit moves money out of my account into it. It's very low maintenance and I like that about it. Every pay rise I receive, the direct debit amount increases (to avoid lifestyle creep). Low effort investing with 7% annual return can't be balked at. I don't intend to withdraw until I retire and assuming the current annual rate remains, I'll have Â£750,000 to withdraw when I retire.
