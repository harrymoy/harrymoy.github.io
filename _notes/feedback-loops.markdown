title: Feedback Loops

A few years ago, a good friend and former work colleague and I had an idea for a business. We liked the idea so much we were in the office late thinking about how to build it. The issue was that as a techie, I obsessed over technology. Drawing diagrams of a microservices architecture that would serve in the back-end. We never built the idea. And looking back, it could have been a Shopify store. 

We… I over-complicated it. 

Complexity is draining. Overthinking ideas can lead to giving up. When ideas aren’t validated, it’s easy to say, “this is complicated”. But could validation arrive sooner?

Recently at work, I messed up. I made a poor decision that took up people’s time. My manager was pleased, however, because we realized it was flawed in week zero. So what did my team do? We worked together and thought of something better. If we discovered it was a poor decision in week five, I wouldn’t have a happy manager. 

Reducing time to get feedback prevents pain later on. 

Let’s say my friend and I didn’t stop with our idea. I slaved away building microservices, and after months of building, our idea sucked. That’d hurt. Instead, we made a Shopify store and shortly realized our idea sucked. That’d hurt less. 

I always recommend getting feedback early on. Where you can, make the feedback loop as short as possible.
