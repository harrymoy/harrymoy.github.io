Frustratingly, one of my favourite quotes is this:

> “It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high, so high in fact that even failure will have in it an echo of glory.” - Bill Nicholson

The reason I say ‘frustratingly’ is because I’m an Arsenal fan. I hate Spurs. But apart from the mention of Tottenham, it’s an excellent quote. The idea is that if we aim high, even when we fail, it’s likely there will be some success. This is another mental model I use, and it’s come in handy.

At university, I had projects I needed to submit. I was given the grading rubric way before submission. This rubric broke down what was needed to achieve 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 marks respectively. A lot of my classmates looked at what 12 marks required, aimed for that and thought bang, 2:1. I took a different approach. What if I aimed for 20, if I got close I’d likely get 12 or even 16. And so I followed that approach, and it went well for me. Meanwhile, if getting 12 marks was my goal, it could have ended badly.

Never aim for average. Aim for it, and the best you can get is average. Aim for excellence, and if you fail, you can still achieve great results.
