Hi, I'm Harry, a senior software engineer from ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ working for a FinTech start-up. I'm also a venture scout for [On Deck](https://beondeck.com) for their ODX accelerator. 

Away from work, I watch football and rugby, listen to podcasts, read books, attempt to cook and lift weights (not at the same time) and write code and real words.

And I have a [weekly newsletter](https://hmoy.me/newsletter) where I write about thoughts on growth and productivity, and share my learnings.

If you'd like talk about whatever, feel free to [book a call](https://hmoy.me/chat) with me.
