I like CleanTech and my portfolio reflects that. DSG Global is a company that has a subsidiary, Imperium Motors, that exclusively licenses and imports electric vehicles from China to sell the North American market.

They've got a wide range of vehicles that target both the consumer and commercial market. For a renewable future, we need plenty of options across all types of vehicles. DSG helps that.

Their balance sheet on the surface looks concerning, there's a lot of red. But they have paid off all of their convertible notes so have removed a lot of their debt. Convertible notes mature into discounted equity in future funding rounds. So paying off convertible notes early before maturity shows the company believes their share price will increase considerably in the future.

For me, this is a cheap stock that has plenty of opportunity for growth.
