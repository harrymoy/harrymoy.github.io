- Build identity capital. Identity capital is the different parts of your life that makes up your experience, this capital can help you connect with people. This could be achieved through extra-curricular activity such as voluntary work
- The strength of weak ties. When we surround ourselves with the same people, we are embedding ourselves further in people who share and reflect our own world-view. By reaching out to the weak ties, acquaintances on the periphery, we're more likely to expand our view
- Ask for favours from people you are only acquaintances with. Those of whom you are less familiar with are more likely to like you more after doing a favour for you
- Externalising stress by repeatedly talking it through means we rely on that too much to be able to handle our stress. Instead, we should internalise it so that we aren't reliant on other people being responsible for reducing our stress
- We develop our sense of time in our 20s and as a result, we should be planning ahead with what we want to do and being intentional with how we conduct ourselves and move forward

### Highlights

- "The future isn’t written in the stars. There are no guarantees. So claim your adulthood. Be intentional. Get to work. Pick your family. Do the math. Make your own certainty. Don’t be defined by what you didn’t know or didn’t do. You are deciding your life right now."
