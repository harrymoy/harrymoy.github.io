title: Asynchronous Working

To anyone willing to listen, I've ranted about the same thing recently. Getting messages saying "hi". At work, I'll get a message from someone saying "Hi Harry" and nothing else. They're waiting for me to respond. But when I get back to them, they're busy doing a task, so they can't say what it is that they want. It becomes a dance I have no interest in doing; it's synchronous working.

Synchronous working is when everyone has to work on the same task at the same time. Think meetings and calls; everyone is on the call together. Last week I had one day that had 7 hours of calls and only 45 minutes free - this isn’t sustainable. I prefer asynchronous work, the opposite of synchronous. I can IM somebody and wait for them to get back to me on their own time. But it also lets me work whenever I like. If I want to take an extra 30 minutes for lunch and work later in the evening, I will. It's my decision.

One day this week I blocked out my calendar, I left all meetings on tentative, and I wouldn't join them unless there was background information. I got a lot of work done. It reminded me of [Paul Graham’s Maker’s Schedule, Manager’s Schedule essay:](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html)

> “A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.”

Context-switching, shifting focus from one task to another, is damaging to productivity. Synchronous working lets context-switching thrive.

This is all part of me figuring out what works best for me. We all have our working styles, and we should optimize when/where we work best. Balance is needed; I know I must be a team player. But I know how I work best, and I'm optimizing for that.

As for people who say ‘hello’, my good friend Fayham sent me [this link.](https://hmoy.me/nohello) That link is now my Microsoft Teams status.
