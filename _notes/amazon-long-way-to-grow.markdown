It may seem impossible, but Amazon have plenty of space for growth. Recently, they announced they’re going to be offering prescriptions in the US. Another market Amazon is able to address. This is alongside general goods, books, video, cloud computing, grocery and more. They have so much diversity in their markets that competitors are customers.

This success is down to Amazon’s scale of distribution. By conquering this, Amazon can offer Prime, which makes customers more loyal to Amazon. Distribution at Amazon’s scale reduces their costs, and pass the saving on to the consumer. This then allows them to cannibalise markets they enter by undercutting the competition. Their demand is unparalleled, and yet they still have enough supply. This only makes them seem dependable to consumers, they know Amazon can deliver.

When Amazon announce they'll enter a market, the market giants' shares drop. That shows the power Amazon wields. There is no company that doesn't fear them.

Once their stock splits, they’re worth an investment. They’re only going to grow.
