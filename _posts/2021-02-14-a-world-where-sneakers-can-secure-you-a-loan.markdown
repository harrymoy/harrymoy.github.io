summary: With NFTs rising in popularity, what's stopping them from digitally proving ownership of a physical asset, and then using that as collateral?

Most loans are unsecured in the finance world if you miss payments, you're in trouble. Mortgages and car financing are the most common examples of a secured loan. Fail to pay, and they're taken away. This works because there's proof of ownership, a house deed or a car ownership certificate. And the proof is undeniable; you own the house or car - there's no doubt.

There's innovation happening in the finance space, the U.S. company Blockfi allows you to secure a loan with Bitcoin. And it's simple. The blockchain provides undeniable proof you own the Bitcoin, and Bitcoin is digital. By being digital, the transfer is straightforward and near-instant.

We're seeing a convergence of digital and physical assets. NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are blockchain tokens which represent something unique. Manufacturers can issue these tokens alongside the creation of a physical asset. When you buy a Patek Philippe watch, you're given a certificate of authenticity. That certificate is the proof if you later want to sell it. By digitising the certificate, you can quickly provide undeniable evidence of ownership on the imaginary Patek Philippe blockchain.

The same can happen for sneakers. A growing market of collectibles, like watches for millennials and Gen Z. When Nike makes a pair, they would assign them an NFT. With that, you know the pair are authentic.

StockX is the biggest exchange for sneakers in the world. And the most trustworthy. As of writing, [there are tens of sneakers selling for over $10,000](https://stockx.com/sneakers/highest-bid).

Imagine a StockX API that provides price data in tandem with a credit risk model for 50% loan-to-value (meaning the loan is worth 50% of the security's value). A pair of [Nike Air Yeezy 2 Red Octobers](https://stockx.com/air-yeezy-2-red-october) could secure you a loan of $7,500. All you do is collateralise the NFT that comes with the sneakers. You can walk around in them all you like, but they're not yours if you miss payments. The NFT becomes owned by the loan provider, so there's undeniable proof they now own the sneakers. And they have a legal right to take them away, just like a car.

I'm using sneakers as an example, but this could apply to any physical asset. It's applying the way we see ownership of houses and cars to collectibles, using digitisation and blockchain to make it undeniable. And asset exchanges give the value of the asset.
