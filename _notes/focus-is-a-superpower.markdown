Countless distractions surround us. They’re at war with one another, fighting for our attention. Notifications are their soldiers and algorithms their generals. The smartphone has thrown fuel over a small ember of ADHD. It’s made focusing difficult. Can you focus on one task, uninterrupted, for more than one hour? If you can, I’m impressed. Glancing at your smartphone counts, even if you don’t unlock it. I’m talking about pure focus on one task and one task only.

It’s tough. And it’s why achieving that level of focus is the most important skill in the 21st century.

So how do we combat it? Fight back against these distractions?

One way is to remove the digital junk food from our digital houses. I use an app that blocks websites for a period of time on my computer. My phone is left in another room. Forcing myself in this manner seems extreme, but I know myself, and I know I lack the discipline otherwise. So I have to take the extreme route.

It isn’t easy currently, but another technique I use is changing my environment. When I was at university, I’d do an hour or two of work in one location and move. That walk to my next destination would be a good break. And then I’d sit down at my new location and get back to work. Often I’d start working very early; I can’t work late into the night, so the mornings are the best time for me to work. (The only problem is I’d often end up in Starbucks, and spend A LOT on coffee).

I previously asked the question “how do we combat it?” This is how I combat it. I know myself, and I know these techniques work for me. They may work for you, but only you know that. If you struggle to focus, take time to reflect and ask yourself how you can fix it. You might need to remove or add stimuli. There may be a certain time of day you work best.

Whatever it is, keep trying until you find what works best for you.
