Two big names on the High Street are struggling. Arcadia is entering administration, Debenhams is liquidating, and it should come at no surprise. For Debenhams, in particular, this is their own doing. A while ago they sold their real estate and leased it back. So now they have to pay leases on a property that is receiving even less footfall.

Repeatedly the Government is called upon to save the High Street. But is it the responsibility of the Government to save them? The chosen methods of helping are to punish online retailers, which isn’t right. Online retailers should not have to suffer because of the High Street. Businesses such instead switch their operating models around. Brick and mortar retail should be an extension of online shopping, a point to pick up ordered goods.

Rather than sell goods, the High Street will need to sell experiences. Experiences such as Ghetto Golf, Flight Club and more. It’s difficult to sell experiences currently, but once vaccinations are out, it will be easier. Low-interest rates will help entrepreneurs found and grow businesses that will offer experiences. The High Street will thrive again, but the zombies need taking off life support first.
