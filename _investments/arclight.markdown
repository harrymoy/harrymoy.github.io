summary: Thoughts and rationale on why I've invested in Arclight
---

ArcLight Clean Transition Corp ($ACTC) is a SPAC that has merged with Proterra, a leading manufacturer in electric commercial vehicles. A SPAC is a blank cheque company that merges with a private company to take them public. This way the private company doesn't have to undergo a laborious IPO process.

Commercial clean vehicles are crucial to reducing our global carbon emissions and there will be a greater push for more and more companies to make the electric transition. The leading opinion is electric vehicles will not be sufficient and hydrogen is the answer. But do you think cities would take the risk of having hydrogen-powered vehicles carrying citizens? I don't think so.

Proterra builds electric powertrains that, and this is important, are in use right now. 2020 revenue is $193mm, which is a drop in the ocean of the $260b total addressable market. Going public through the merger with $ACTC will give them the money to push for significant growth. And they have experienced leadership in electrical engineering, they know what they're doing.

Daimler is a customer of their powertrain. Daimler. They're the largest commercial vehicle manufacturer in the world and they're using Proterra. This is huge for Proterra's brand as it solidifies them as a market leader, with others manufacturers looking at how Daimler make us of their powertrains. And Daimler are an investor, so they have a lower interest in building their own powertrains.

Engineering and manufacturing happens in California. While that will make labor cost expensive, I see electric powertrains being a strategic asset that the US government will want to be manufactured domestically. And will reward companies doing so.
