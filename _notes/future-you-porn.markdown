Dopamine is incredible. It’s literally meant to be. It’s what tells our brain that something is pleasurable and causes us to seek out whatever will give us more of it. I love it. But we’re now in an abundance of dopamine. It’s so easy to get and to imagine. We’re becoming lazier because of it. Instead of doing work, completing it and getting that sweet sweet dopamine, we just think about it.

This is what I call ‘Future You Porn’.

I’ve caught myself doing it often. Thinking about doing work, completing it and somehow through a series of crazy ending up in Miami. Don’t be me. Because the work will never get done. Lately, when these delusional thoughts hit my brain, I remind myself of what work needs to be done. By doing I’m preventing mental masturbation and grounding myself in reality.

If this is something that happens to you, give it a go. Become conscious of reality and what needs to be done.
