Over the past 10 years, Domino’s stock has outperformed Facebook, Google, Apple and other tech giants. Their stock price has increased by 4500% since the start of the decade.

Their operating model is perfect to handle a global pandemic where everyone stays in. No indoor seating, sites based in urbanized areas and an ordering system. 

A new type of business is on the rise: ‘cloud kitchens’, which rent kitchens to restaurants. By renting, the initial capital spend is much lower than setting up a kitchen. Many of the cloud kitchens that are being set up are in urbanized areas, with no indoor seating. 

Deliveroo, Uber Eats, Just Eat etc. offer an ordering system and handle distribution. This means a restaurant focuses on recruitment, pricing and food. Bootstrapping a takeaway will become much easier.

In years time, many small food takeaways will have the ability to follow Domino’s lead.
