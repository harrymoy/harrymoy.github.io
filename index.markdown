I write code, I angel invest and make things like [Nearly](https://www.producthunt.com/products/nearly) and [London Lime Parking](https://lime-parking.vercel.app/).

Professionally, I've design and built systems in healthcare, financial services and for designated critical national infrastructure. So, stuff that can't go wrong. 

When I was 14, I built a website and wrote reviews and news about video games. And one day, an early copy of Skyrim came through my letterbox. 

Before that I used to make mods for a game called The Movies, where I first learnt to code.

My angel portfolio includes companies building in:
- Cultivated meat
- Renewable energy
- HR automation
- Marine logistics
- Space travel

Feel free to reach out to me on [X](https://x.com/harrymoy), it's where I spend far too much of my time.
