- We often believe we have a lot of control over events but we fail to factor in how much luck plays a role in our life
- When we overestimate our ability in comparison to luck, we learn less from the environment
- Early success makes us remove the understanding of luck from the equation. Toss a coin and get the first few right, you believe you are *actually* good at predicting a coin toss
- When learning, if we have a real stake in what we're learning then we are more likely to retain that information better
- Things need to go wrong before understanding how much we can take
- We need to maximise benefit in circumstances that are advantageous to us while minimising loss during disadvantaged times
- Similar to the concept described about early success, when success is happening due to chance we often forget that something bad can happen. An opposite of the Gambler's Fallacy
- Be wary of your emotional state and how that affects you. Your emotional state can compound and make you begin to feel badly
- To truly understand the behaviours of other people, firstly you need to understand your own behaviours and what causes them
- We often think of what the best-case scenario is going into activities but we don't often extrapolate the past to determine what challenges we may face
- Emotions are not often part of a rational decision process - they should be dismissed as sources of information
