<h1>My Investments</h1>
<p>Transparency is important. There's a dangerous rise currently in 'TikTok traders' that post their astonishing returns and encourage viewers to do the same. Making a quick buck from investing is made out to be very easy. But they only show their wins, not their losses. This is dangerous. And combine that with no explanation of the rationale behind their investments.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/harrymoy">Twitter</a>, I tweet sometimes about my investments. So for the sake of transparency, this is a list of what I hold and why I hold them. I'm also including the average buy price where I have the data.</p>
    
<p>Not only am I providing my rationale FOR investing, but I'm also explaining the argument AGAINST investing. Having a balanced view makes the decision-making process more thoughtful.</p>
    
<p>I am in my investments for the long-term, all of my investments I have great conviction in and believe they will continue to grow.</p>
    
<p><strong>In no way shape or form am I advising anybody to invest in any of the below investments. In fact, in some I'm explaining why NOT to invest. This is not financial advice.</strong></p>

<h1>My Investing Principles</h1>
<p>Inspired by Kalani Scarrott's describing his <a href="https://kscarrott.com/investment-strategy/">investment strategy</a>, I thought I'd write something similar. I don't have a degree in finance or any subject investment-related. Instead, I'm a techie that enjoys investing in companies and I have a set of principles that I think about before investing.</p>

<h2>1. Stick to products/services that interest me</h2>
<p>Companies making cool products interest me, so it excites me to research their industry and how they fit in that market. Research is critical. I don't want to spend time exploring products that bore me. I love innovation and thinking about the future. So products that I can see playing a part in the future deserve a spot in my portfolio. </p>

<h2>2.Apply a macro-lens</h2>
<p>Our world is global. Regulators are everywhere. I must think about the macro-environment affecting the companyâ€”an example - Facebook and regulation. Will trustbusters come for Facebook? I doubt it, but it's a point to think about before investing. My investment in Intel was due to the geopolitical environment. Semiconductor wars occurring between America and China.</p>

<h2>3. No Platform-Dependence</h2>
<p>Any company that relies on another company's platform is a no-go for me. The only exception here is large clients - i.e. Netflix with AWS. But we have seen some platform owners flex their muscles with rule-breaking. Currently, Epic Games are taking Apple to court over removing Fortnite from the App Store. This could happen to anyone. Investing in a company dependent on another is dangerous.</p>

<h2>4. Not Be Evil</h2>
<p>I don't consider any company I've invested in as 'evil'. They do not exploit their customers or infringe their privacy and do not contribute to our planet's demise. Evil companies face risk from regulators, they may make a lot of money, but eventually, they get their comeuppance.</p>

<h2>5. Asymmetric Bets</h2>
<p>This principle acts alone. Does the potential upside outweigh the potential downside? An example - I stuck a few hundred dollars into Dogecoin; I can afford to lose it. But if Doge gets to $1, I have $12,000. The upside outweighs the downside.</p>

<h2>6. Conviction Plays</h2>
<p>I'm 26 as I'm writing this. My income is steady, and I save money. Every company I invest in, I have conviction in their product, values and leadership. I will not withdraw when times get tough; I will weather the storm. And so, before investing I wonder if I'd have conviction when the storm arrives.</p>

<h2>7. Can I rationalize it?</h2>
<p>Every investment I make, I write about on this site. Writing is an exercise in rationalizing the investment. If I can't write the rationale, it's a lame investment.</p>

<hr/>
<p>These are principles I use before investing. I don't apply all of them with some investments (Dogecoin), but it's a useful mental exercise to perform.</p>
