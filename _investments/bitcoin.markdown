## Why I've Invested

Bitcoin is a revolution. It's leading the change to how we think about money. And as a techie, I think it's cool.

But there is also a positive case for Bitcoin as a financial asset.

Central banks have decided that quantitative easing (pumping money into the economy by purchasing assets like bonds) is their go-to method to help the economy. Inflation is low and they aim for 2% inflation each year. Currently it's below 1%. And so more and more money is pumped into the economy. Cash savings become worth less and less through what may as well be a stealth tax.

And as the meme goes, Bitcoin solves this.

Storing money in alternative assets and stores of value is a way to hedge against inflation. And I've chosen Bitcoin. Yes, it's volatile. But it's easy to buy and easy to liquidate. Almost no other asset allows me to convert it to GBP and withdraw my GBP balance as quickly as Bitcoin does.

There's only a finite amount of Bitcoin. Only 21m will ever be mined and nearly 19m has already been mined. So there's 2m left and institutional investors want in. MicroStrategy, Square and Tesla have all bought in and more companies will place it on their balance sheet. As these larger players swallow up the remaining Bitcoin, the value will only go up.

I fully believe we will see over $100k Bitcoin by the end of 2021. And I'll have [laser eyes](https://twitter.com/HarryMoy) until then.
