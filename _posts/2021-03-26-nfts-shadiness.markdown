*TL;DR I like NFTs but question who's buying them and the hosting of them.*

NFTs (Non-fungible tokens) are digital tokens sitting on a blockchain that get their value from the state they're in. Gold is fungible. 1kg of gold in coins and 1kg of gold in bars are worth the same. NFTs are, well, not like that, and [I like the idea of them.](https://harrymoy.com/secure-loan-with-sneakers) I see them as the digitization of physical assets.

Digital art is gaining traction, with the notable sale of Beeple's artwork called 'Everydays' for $69m. That's an astonishing amount of money. Many others are now following suit; other pieces of art are selling for hundreds of thousands. And it's not only art. [Jack Dorsey's first tweet sold for $2.9m](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344937/jack-dorsey-nft-sold-first-tweet-ethereum-cryptocurrency-twitter). A tweet for $2.9m. $2.9m. 

This sounds like a bubble to me. Or maybe I don't get it.

It could be both, but there is some thought behind my scepticism. 

### Hosting NFTs
NFTs sit on a blockchain and the creator cannot change them, in principle. I won't get into the detail of changing NFTs, so we'll assume they cannot be changed for this post. 

Last week my friend Tom pointed me to this tweet thread. The findings astonish me. Nifty Gateway is a platform that is the broker between buyer and seller of NFTs. The thread shows that the NFT is a link to Nifty Gateway's server, which hosts the digital art. So if their servers go down, or they go bust, you've lost your art. 

Let's apply this principle to the real world. If I buy a piece of art via a broker, that broker's business doesn't bother me. The broker goes bankrupt, and my art doesn't disappear. I still have it. 

**That isn't the case with NFTs.**

I thought the blockchain would host the NFT as a blob. A blob is a binary machine code that represents media. So the art would be code on the blockchain. Like this:

If the artists are aware of this, I question their intentions with NFTs. As creatives, you'd think that they'd want to know their art is secure. I know there's a lot of money to make, but it rubs me the wrong way. Why would someone committed to their craft be okay with their work potentially being lost forever? The answer is money, but I wish it weren't. I'd expect an artist with love for their craft to value integrity more than cold, hard cash. 

And that leads me to the next cause for my scepticism. 
### NFT buyers
The NFT bubble is down to crypto bros. I do not doubt it. In my mind, NFTs are participating in a sub-market of the broader cryptocurrency market. Crypto is in a bull-market currently; prices are skyrocketing. And it's making holders a lot of cash.

But fuck fiat, right? This is the digital revolution! So the bros aren't spending their money on physical goods like people having fun staying poor. No, they're buying digital art. 

As others get caught up in the mania, they're stocking up on whatever NFT they can get. And then soon, they'll sell them at a higher price.

This reminds me of the 'Greater Fool' theory in economics. You buy an asset at a high price because you think a greater fool will later come along and buy the asset from you at a higher price. 

Even though Christie's sold Everydays (the art I mentioned earlier), this isn't the endorsement it seems. A crypto-bro bought it. 

A crypto bro who will want to find a greater fool, assuming the NFT URL doesn't get lost in the meantime.
