Every decision has risk. Some have more risk than others. And they have an upside; that’s often why we make a decision, whatever we choose leads to the better outcome.

And that’s where asymmetric bets come in.

Where the balance is in obvious favour to the upside, bet on it. I’ll illustrate by breaking down my investment in Dogecoin.

For a few hundred pounds, I purchased thousands of Dogecoin. The risk is that I could lose it all (and still could), which is low risk because it’s only a few hundred. But the upside is that Dogecoin could increase in price and be worth a lot of money. And that happened.

So there’s low-risk with high reward. That’s the asymmetry. But it’s low-risk because I’ve given myself financial coverage. I’ve worked to reduce the risk, and that shifts the balance in favour of the upside.

When making decisions, think about the risks and the potential upside. Don’t get weighed down by the risk.
