Hi, I'm Harry, a technology architect from üá¨üáß as part of my day job I solve problems for the company I work for with different technologies. I started out my career as a .NET developer, working for a financial services company and lead the team writing a replacement to the company's credit-checking engine. Since then I have earned (and need to renew) an AWS Solution Architect certification, although I work exclusively with Azure in my day-job currently.

Away from work, I'm an Arsenal fan ‚öΩÔ∏è and volunteer for two different charities, chairing the board for one of them. Often I'm researching stocks, listening to podcasts, reading books, attempting to cook and lift weights (not at the same time) and writing code and real words.

With my good friend Sam, I also write on a blog called [Futurae Fidelis](https://futuraefidelis.co.uk). This is all about the future and futurism, something that really excites me.

This website is a dump for my public notes and thoughts.
