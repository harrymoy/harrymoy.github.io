I love Twitter. It's my favourite social network. I fully believe there is no social network as much at the centre of pop culture as Twitter. Twitter not only shares news, it creates news. The number of times you see 'x tweeted this' being a news story is only increasing. More eyes are coming to Twitter and staying on Twitter (monetizable daily active users are up 27% YoY). It may not be as cool as Instagram or TikTok, but it's certainly cooler than Facebook.

Advertisers are spotting this too. Both Ad and Mobile App Promotion (advertising apps to users on mobiles) revenue are up 31% and >50% YoY. Twitter intends to double revenue to $7.5b or more in 2023. Considering Facebook has revenues of >$85b (across Facebook, Instagram, and Oculus), it does appear there's great potential for Twitter to increase their revenue beyond $7.5b.

But how can they achieve this?

There's a new economy emerging, dubbed the 'creator economy'. These are independent people creating content and monetizing it online, YouTubers are an easy example. Twitter is at the heart of this economy, previously it served as the distribution mechanism by directing Twitter followers to content locations.

But now Twitter is becoming the content location.

Creators will be able to monetize their followers through 'Super Followers', where followers will pay $5 to become a 'Super Follower' and receive exclusive content. The best way I've seen it described is 'OnlyFans for Nerds'. I don't see this as being a significant revenue stream but I foresee it bringing in a steady amount of revenue.

Then there's Revue. Revue is an email newsletter platform that Twitter has recently acquired. Substack has previously been the platform people starting out newsletters would use, now Twitter can capture some of those people. And newsletters are quite lucrative. I personally pay for 3 of them to the tune of $220 in total and Twitter would get $11 of that. Like Super Followers, this won't drive huge revenue but it will introduce a steady recurring amount of money.

Twitter's Clubhouse competitor, Spaces, an audio-only chatroom is also a great opportunity for both brands and creators to get creative with how they interact with their audiences. With how it's monetized, I could see brands paying for sponsored spots. Think a movie close to release having a Q+A through Spaces with the actors and director. It could be pushed right at the front of users' feeds and it'd be a more intimate experience for fans.

My biggest regret with Twitter is not buying in sooner, but I'm glad I've bought in before it's $100+ because I can see that happening before the end of 2021.
