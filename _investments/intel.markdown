Intel is doomed. Apparently. They were once a manufacturing chip giant but now they are a mocked in the semiconductor industry. Repeatedly late in releasing products to the point that their customers are moving to designing their own chips. Apple has recently been transitioning the Mac line to using the M-Series chips and are using TSMC to manufacture their chips. This vertical integration makes sense for Apple. But there is a chance that other computer makers will follow in their direction after seeing their success.

So why am I invested in Intel?

Intel are American. The geopolitics of chip manufacturing is only going to become more intense. Most of Intel's semiconductor fabrication happens in the United States. This is advantageous to Intel. While American labour is more expensive than Chinese, what's being manufactured is sensitive and has serious security implications. It wouldn't surprise me if we saw subsidies from the US Government to Intel to keep them manufacturing in the US and potentially increase their domestic operation.

But what about TSMC?

Well, the 'T' in TSMC stands for 'Taiwan'. Taiwan is not a a part of China, but China thinks it is. And they have been very clear that Taiwan will at some point unify with China again. As China becomes more and more aggressive in its stance on Taiwan, supply chains may eventually be disrupted and cause customers to rely less on TSMC.

There's also the brand. I believe for most consumers, Intel still stands for quality and is the only recognisable brand in computer chips. I believe that customers would pick the Intel-branded machine out of similarly priced products simply because it's Intel.

The leadership at Intel is also changing. It's becoming more technical and could potentially make the necessary changes to Intel's operating structure so that there aren't repeated delays in releasing new generations of chips.
