I'm a software engineer working in London for a HealthTech. My previous experience is working in FinTech.

Away from my day job, I angel invest and build products (such as [Nearly](https://www.producthunt.com/products/nearly)).

Investments include:
- Cultivated meat
- Renewable energy
- HR automation
- Marine logistics
- Space travel

Feel free to reach out to me on [X](https://x.com/harrymoy), it's where I spend far too much of my time.
