Coinbase has filed their S-1 (an overview of their business) for a direct listing to go public on the NASDAQ. This is a huge moment for the cryptoeconomy. Love Coinbase or hate them, this is big. I first bought Bitcoin in 2012 at the height of the Silk Road days and it was a difficult user experience, involving shady transactions and no verification. Since then, we're seeing KYC and AML becoming standard for large crypto exchanges.

And most starting their crypto journey will start it with Coinbase.

I'm not a financial analyst so I can't read their balance sheet and reel off how good or bad their finances are but there are some numbers that stick out. Net Revenue for 2020 was $1,141m while 2019 was $482m. This is a significant increase and that can be associated with the increasing interest in crypto-assets. Even my dad owns some Bitcoin. But while net revenue increased by over 100%, their net income went from a loss of $30m to a profit of $322m. This makes me ask the question - can Coinbase only turn a profit in a crypto bull market?

I think, yes. Operating expenses did go up but as a percentage increase, no way near the amount that their net revenue increased by. This suggests to me that their fixed expenses are high so any profit requires large transaction volume. As such it becomes difficult to assess Coinbase's business model since we're only seeing profit from the lens of a 2020 bull market.

Coinbase is aiming to be the point of call for institutional investors. They apparently supported Tesla's recent purchase of $1.5b Bitcoin, which with the institutional investor fee of 0.05%, netted them $750,000. Not bad. And with more institutions getting onboard with crypto, this could become a decent revenue stream for them.

Then there's additional products such as their savings product. According to the S-1, 21% of retail investors 'engaged' with one of these additional products. And Coinbase earned an extra 90% in revenue per each of these users. This is a large increase. But for it to significantly affect Coinbase's bottom-line, the conversion needs to increase from 21%.

Some of the risk factors listed by Coinbase almost every tech company faces - cyber-security and the platform dominance of Apple and Google. Beyond that, their risks are more similar to a financial services company. Asset depreciation, financial law and third-party services. And then there's the crypto factors.

Scared governments, blockchains breaking, Satoshi Nakamoto revealing themselves. Coinbase are already demonstrating their preparedness to follow governments' orders. The SEC are suing Ripple and so Coinbase delisted the XRP token as a precautionary step. Unfortunately for them, other exchanges continue to list it, so people will go to them. Which is another risk to Coinbase. Dodgy exchanges getting dodgy customers, criminals don't want to undergo KYC checks!

Initially I felt bullish about Coinbase but the more I think about it, the less I am. I probably will add them to my portfolio but not by as much as I initially intended to. I need to see what they're like in a market cycle that isn't wild, and I've only 2019 to base that off of. They didn't do great then. But I do believe they have potential. If more people become retail investors in crypto, they will likely start with Coinbase. And if Coinbase can woo more institutions then they'll be less reliant on bull markets and retail investors going crazy in them.

Overall, I'm a wait and see with Coinbase before giving them a reasonable weighting in my portfolio.
