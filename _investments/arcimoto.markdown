Arcimoto ($FUV) is a company developing small electric vehicles they call 'Fun Utility Vehicles' or FUVs. FUVs are small-sized EVs that can fit two people in them and the reviews suggest they're a great vehicle to drive.

## Why I've Invested

$FUV's share price has exploded lately as they begin to start expanding. They've noticed that they can target delivery drivers and have built a specialised FUV for delivery drivers to use. There's also the Rapid Responder, that's great for sectors such as university campus security so that they can quickly respond to incidents.

The future of mobility is changing beyond the move to electric. Roads are becoming increasingly congested as houses have more and more cars and especially with larger vehicles. As roads are difficult to increase in size, FUVs will be a great alternative to small cars such as the Chevrolet Matiz.

By performing clever M&A, $FUV are improving the quality of their product, increasing production and bringing great talent on board. Electrical vehicle grants make the FUV very affordable while also operating at a gross margin of >40%.

This is a company that was close to bankruptcy but they have been reducing their liabilities over the past year and have less debt. 

$FUV remind me of Tesla, a company that takes a slow but steady approach that involves reinvesting profits into the company to fund growth.

## Why Not to Invest

The EV market is becoming more and more saturated as time goes on. Not only are the 'traditional' car manufacturers ramping up their EV manufacturing, there's now completely new companies making them too. Lucid, Nio, Faraday Future, etc. And these are companies with a lot of investment behind them.

Then there's the vehicle itself. It's a different kind of vehicle to what we're used to on the roads. Arcimoto needs potential customers to come in with an open-mind to convert them into paying customers. And as previously mentioned, there are plenty of other options for them if they want a 'normal' car.
